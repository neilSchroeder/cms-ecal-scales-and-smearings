# PyValidation

A validation suite for the scales and smearings built in python to be used on conjunction with cms-ecal-scales-and-smearings

## Motivation

This project exists to round out the cms-ecal-scales-and-smearings framework and provide a full derivation-to-paper-quality-plots functionality.
The goal of this software is to replace the current, rather clunky, c++ code used to validate the scales and smearings.
Additionally, this software serves as a portion of the thesis of Neil Schroeder from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities School of Physics and Astronomy.

## To Do

- Plotting:
    - Come up with some sort of config file scheme for making plots
    - Write a plot class, probably
    - Write a plotter (explore options other than matplot lib)



## Features

At least one good line of python

# CMS - ECAL - Scales and Smearings

A new python framework for deriving the residual scales and additional smearings for the electron energy scale.

## Getting Started

Some basic instructions on how to get started:

### Prerequisites

The framework was built for use with python 3.6.4 on CMSSW_10_2_14.

### Installing

```
cmsrel CMSSW_10_2_14
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/nschroed/cms-ecal-scales-and-smearings.git
```
Now you'll want to checkout your own branch (name it something useful)
```
git branch myBranch
```
And push it to your gitlab repo
```
git push --set-upstream origin myBranch
```
